        <p>:A function is a bundle of code that performs a set of procedures. </p>
      </div>
      <li>Methods</li>
      <p>:  A method is a type of function. It is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</p>
      <li>Arguments</li>
      <p>: Both functions and methods can have arguments. Arguments are passed into the parentheses ().</p>
      <li>Parameters</li>
      <p>: This is a placeholder variable that is included in a function definition. There is not value for parameters. Once the function is called, an argument is passed into the parameter and gives it a value.</p>
      <li>Return</li>
      <p>: The return value is the method's response.</p>
      <li>Chaining methods</li>
      <p>:is a programming strategy that simplifies and embellishes your code. It is a mechanism of calling a method on another method of the same object.</p>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <p>:is used for data values that are made up of ordered sequences of characters, such as "hello world". A string can contain any sequence of characters, visible or invisible, and characters may be repeated.</p>
      li>Booleans</li>
      <p>:a logical data type that can have only the values true or false . For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).</p>
      <li>Undefined</li>
      <p>:a condition where an expression does not have a correct value, although it is syntactically correct. An undefined value must not be confused with empty string, Boolean "false" or other "empty" (but defined) values.</p>
      <li>NaN</li>
      <p>:an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. For example, 0/0 or the square root of a negative number would return a NaN result.</p>
      <li>Null</li>
      <p>:Null is a built-in constant that has a value of zero. It is the same as the character 0 used to terminate strings in C. Null can also be the value of a pointer, which is the same as zero unless the CPU supports a special bit pattern for a null pointer.</p>
      <li>Alert</li>
      <p>:a type of "pop-up" message to users of a script. An alert could be anything from notifying the user of an error to saying a short phrase such as "Hi". </p>
      <li>Comments</li>
      <p>:a text note added to source code to provide explanatory information, usually about the function of the code.</p>
      <li>jQuery</li>
      <p>:a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development. </p>
      <li>Attributes</li>
      <p>:a changeable property or characteristic of some component of a program that can be set to different values.</p> -->
